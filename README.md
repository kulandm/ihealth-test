The Test:

1. add some simple validation (e.g. longer than 5 characters) to the todo-task input field, using the "react-redux-form‚Äù npm package. Put the input in a form and use the form reducer (https://davidkpiano.gitbooks.io/react-redux-form/content/form_reducers.html) to do client-side validation before a task is added.

2. add the ability to prioritize tasks, so that the more important tasks will appear above the less important tasks. (Add a dropdown to select from "Low", "Medium", "High" priorities)

Please save all UI states in redux store, rather than in React states.

Please complete it within 2 days and send it as a zip file with local git commits. Please do not post the solution on github or anywhere public.
